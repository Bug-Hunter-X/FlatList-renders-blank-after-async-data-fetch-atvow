# React Native FlatList Blank Rendering After Async Data Fetch

This repository demonstrates a common issue in React Native where a FlatList component renders blank even after successfully fetching data asynchronously.  The problem stems from the component failing to re-render appropriately after the state update. 

The `bug.js` file contains the problematic code.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a solution.

## Issue Description

The application fetches data using `useEffect` and `async/await`.  While the data fetches successfully, the FlatList displays nothing, leading to a blank screen. This often happens when state updates do not trigger a re-render, especially with asynchronous operations.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring the FlatList correctly re-renders by using the `keyExtractor` prop in the FlatList component to properly manage item identifiers.
